- 👋 Hi, I’m George
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a professional programmer with a diverse skill set to bring to any table. I am currently a CNC programmer, and Design Engineer. College never worked for me, but because of this I have experience in HTML and some JAVA/C++ along with G-Code. I have always managed to work and train myself into promotion after promotion starting in basic assembly and fabrication followed by sneaking my way in with a second shift laser operator to learn the machinery and pick up the skills, subsequently earning the lead position. At my current company I worked from being one of 12 laser operators to the lead programmer for the  company in my first 2 years. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and brushing up on my HTML, I hope to learn Databases and Django to stack on to my Python. I have at this point in time started automating paperwork we do at work sorting out and formatting excel spreadsheets.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will challenge me and that will help me to become a better programmer. Along with building my portfolio
- 📫 Message me here and I will have other places added later.
